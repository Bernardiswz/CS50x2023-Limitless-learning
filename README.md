## Introduction ##
Hello! Welcome to my project [name later], this website was designed with the intent of provide the user with a
versatile toolkit to their learning journey in any subject of their choice. According to some of the most efficient
learning techniques around, such as the pomodoro technique, the flashcards technique (spaced repetition), aswell as
having an short desciption of these techniques ([about](/templates/about.html)).

With the use of flask as the backend framework for python to the server-side aspect of the project alongside HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), JavaScript and a SQL database, handled by sqlite3 this project was made possible. Consisting mainly of the aspects of providing each individual registered
user with their own session registered data that can be retrieved on their login, allowing users to keep track of their progress on their learning
journey aswell as customizing their own experience.
